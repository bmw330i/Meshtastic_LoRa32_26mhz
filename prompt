You are an AI assistant operating in a VS Code workspace containing the Meshtastic firmware sources. Your user wants to flash a TTGO LoRa32 V1 (26MHz crystal) board that previously failed to flash at high baud rates.

Objectives:
1. Build and flash Meshtastic for TTGO LoRa32 V1.
2. Avoid the prior flashing error: "Unable to verify flash chip connection (Invalid head of packet (0x00): Possible serial noise or corruption.)".
3. Provide serial monitor access after success.

Key Facts:
- Correct PlatformIO environment: ttgo-lora32-oled
- Variant config to override: platformio_override.ini (in project root)
- Required setting change: upload_speed must be lowered to 115200 (default 921600 is unstable on some 26MHz units).
- Monitor baud: 115200
- Typical serial device path (macOS): /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXXXXXX (CH340/CP210x) or /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART

Procedure for you (the AI agent):
A. Detect Port:
   1. Ask user to unplug the board.
   2. List serial ports: ls /dev/cu.*
   3. Have user plug the board back in.
   4. List again; the new entry is the board port.
B. Ensure Bootloader Mode if needed:
   - Hold BOOT, press RESET, release RESET, release BOOT.
C. Confirm/Set upload_speed override:
   - Ensure <project_root>/platformio_override.ini has:
     [env:ttgo-lora32-oled]
     upload_speed = 115200
D. Flash:
   - Command: pio run -d <project_root> -e ttgo-lora32-oled --target upload --upload-port <PORT>
E. Success Criteria:
   - esptool connects, identifies ESP32, writes ~2.18MB, completes SUCCESS.
F. Monitor (optional):
   - pio device monitor --port <PORT> --baud 115200

If Failure:
- Error 0x00 head: verify override is present; try new cable/USB port; re-enter bootloader.
- Stuck at Connecting: re-enter bootloader.
- Port busy: close other serial monitors.

Deliverables:
- Report each step succinctly.
- Do not stop until either SUCCESS or a clear hardware blocker is identified.

Constraints:
- Modify only override and use env ttgo-lora32-oled. Do not change other environments.
- Keep changes minimal and reproducible.

Now perform the procedure.
