This project provides customized Meshtastic firmware builds specifically adapted for Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 boards with 26MHz crystals. It supports both V1 (4MB flash) and V2/V2.1 (8MB flash) variants, ensuring these older boards remain functional for mesh networking rather than becoming e-waste.

The repository contains:
- Complete source code for Meshtastic firmware
- PlatformIO project configuration optimized for 26MHz crystal boards
- Board-specific configurations for heltec-v1, heltec-v2, and heltec-v2_1 environments
- Custom partition tables for different flash sizes
- Automated flashing script with board detection
- Secure credential configuration via .env file
- Comprehensive documentation in README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md

Key features:
- Automatic board detection and appropriate firmware selection
- Size-optimized builds for V1 boards (4MB flash constraints)
- Secure default credential replacement
- Easy flashing with menu-driven script
- Full Meshtastic mesh networking capabilities
- GPS, WiFi, MQTT, and BLE support
